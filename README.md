#  (-⊙⩊⊙)𝇌 ✎ Academic Information System (SIA) — Lecturer Prototype ⋆｡°✩
୭  📓 ✧ ˚.  ᵎᵎ  
This project is a **web-based Academic Information System (SIA) prototype** designed specifically for **lecturers**. The platform provides an intuitive interface for managing and accessing essential academic data such as **class schedules, student lists, attendance records, assignments, course materials, leave requests, and personal information**.

This is a **frontend-only prototype** (no database or backend yet).  
I designed the **UI/UX from scratch**, and built the **entire frontend** to demonstrate layout design, workflow structure, and user interaction flow.
